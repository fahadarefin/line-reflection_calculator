# line-reflection_calculator
This calculator calculates the reflection of a straight-line in respect of another straight line.  T                                             
Input the lines in ax+by+c=0 formate.                                     
a1x+b1y+c1=0 is the main line.                                         
a2x+b2y+c2=0 is the reference line.                                    
The ans will be in y-y1=m(x-x1) format.
here m= the slope of that line.
